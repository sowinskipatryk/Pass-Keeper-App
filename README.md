# Keyper - Password Manager App

This application is a password management tool written using Kotlin and Java languages. It is a display of skills that are so important in programming, namely quick learning and googling, as the application was written while learning the mentioned languages on-the-go (with a minor theoretical and syntactical introduction). For this reason, a cautionary margin must be maintained while using the app, although every effort has been made to ensure that the security is high and so is user experience. App is linked with Cipher encrypted SQLite database. The access to the application is obtained by entering the Master Key or using biometric authentication.
